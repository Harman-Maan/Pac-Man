# Pac-Man
Its Pac Man, I took inspiration and some code form https://github.com/kubowania (Available with Tutorial support on her Youtube channel,It is just a simple code with not too much of design because she made it for beginner).
I added several thing like Ghost images instead of boxes, Some changes in map so that Ghosts can move freely and effetively.
Also I designed the main box in CSS, added the Pac Man's moving mouth animation.

All the Images and code are attached.

Thats all have fun with the Code.
You are free to use it.
